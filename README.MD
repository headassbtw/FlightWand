# FlightWand

A flight stick emulator for VR controllers (primarily the HTC Vive wand, hence the name)
utilizing OpenXR and evdev

> [!WARNING]  
> This program is written exclusively for OpenXR and Linux.
> It will not work under Windows and/or other VR runtimes.

# To-Do
* Support other controllers (This is theoretically trivial)
* Handle other errors more gracefully
* Expose more settings in a user-friendly way (offsets, centering, etc)
* 3D wireframe flightstick :D
